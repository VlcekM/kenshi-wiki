Say you have a lovely modded race added by a mod called Cinderella Race and you have also subbed to a wonderful hair mod, called Anime Hairs and now you are wondering how lovely it would be to have Anime Hairs on Cinderella. Fret not, here's a step by step:

1.  Move both/all mods to your kenshi/mods folder: Here's instructions how to do that; [How to move mods from Workshop to kenshi/mods](/how-to-move-mods-from-workshop-to-kenshi/mods)
2.  After you have named all folders with their mod name, open FCS and tag both/all mods relevant to the patch and create a new mod
3.  Give your mod a distinctive, descriptive name, fe. Anime Hairs to Cinderella Race Patch
4.  Go to the Race tab and find the Cinderella Race, open it.
5.  Open a second FCS (do not use the launcher, open it from within the installation folder) and open the Anime Hairs mod (your hair or face items you want to add to Cinderella Race) Use this other FCS as your guide, look on the changes tab to find the hairdo names.
6.  If you are lucky and the maker of the hairs was prudent, all hairdos should have a StringID which includes the same mod name, we can use that as a search word.
7.  On the Cinderella Race File in your first FCS, add hairs from the dropdown menu. On the bottom of the hair reference window as a search word. You can type parts of the donor mod name, if they all use it, you should see all of them listed there. Do note some of the vanilla hairdos contain the name anime in them, so pick only the correct ones from your source mod.
8.  select them holding ctrl and hit Ok. Save.

That's it. Adding face textures works the same way, except there is a separate slots for female heads and male heads.

DO NOTE: often mere adding the files to a race is not enough. If the race's skin base color does not match the face skin base color, the race cannot use the faces without it looking bad. Same goes if the race uses different UV layout for the face than the face texture.

Hair meshes may be too big or too small, or positioned weirdly. If that is the case, you might want to ask the original maker of the face or hairdo to make a patch to Cinderella or whatever race it is you want the patch for. Remember, you may not adjust a file someone else made and publish it without the original creator's permission. You may publish a patch mod created like this (above step by) but not include any of the actual face or hair meshes or textures. Not even if you edited them. You need a permission for that. Naturally you can make whatever patch for your own use.
