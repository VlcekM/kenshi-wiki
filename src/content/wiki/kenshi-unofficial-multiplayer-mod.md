# Kenshi Unofficial Multiplayer Mod

The **Kenshi Unofficial Multiplayer Mod** is a community‑developed project that enables limited cooperative multiplayer functionality in _Kenshi_, the single‑player squad‑based sandbox RPG created by Lo‑Fi Games. While _Kenshi_ was designed and released as a strictly offline, single‑player experience, this mod attempts to synchronize core gameplay systems across multiple clients, allowing players to explore, build, and fight together within a shared world.

The project is not affiliated with Lo‑Fi Games and is considered experimental, with varying levels of stability depending on version, host hardware, and player count.

## Overview

The mod introduces a lightweight client–server architecture that allows one player to host a world while others connect as clients. It focuses on synchronizing essential gameplay elements such as character movement, combat states, inventory changes, and world events. Due to the complexity of _Kenshi_’s simulation engine, the mod does not provide full parity with single‑player behavior, but it enables a functional cooperative experience for small groups.

The mod is primarily aimed at players who want to share exploration, base building, and squad management with friends while accepting the limitations of unofficial multiplayer support.

## Features

### Multiplayer Connectivity

-   Host‑client model with LAN or internet connections
-   Support for 2–6 players depending on system performance
-   Optional password‑protected sessions

### Character & Squad Synchronization

-   Real‑time syncing of player‑controlled characters
-   Shared or separate squads depending on host settings
-   Basic AI behavior replicated across clients

### Combat Synchronization

-   Position, animation, and health state syncing
-   Shared aggro and enemy targeting
-   Occasional desync may occur during large battles

### World & Base Building

-   Shared access to buildings, crafting stations, and storage
-   Construction progress synchronized across clients
-   Research tree shared between all players

### Inventory & Economy

-   Trading between players
-   Shared access to shops and vendors
-   Item pickup, crafting output, and container contents synced

## Limitations

Because _Kenshi_ was not designed for multiplayer, several systems remain partially implemented or unstable:

-   Pathfinding desync during large squad movements
-   Occasional rubber‑banding in crowded cities
-   AI schedules not always consistent across clients
-   Weather and lighting may visually differ between players
-   Save files are host‑only and not cross‑compatible with vanilla saves
-   Mods that alter AI, factions, or world states may cause conflicts

The developers of the mod recommend small group play and avoiding extremely large squads to maintain stability.

## Installation

The mod is typically distributed through Nexus Mods or GitHub. Installation generally involves:

1.  Downloading the mod package
2.  Extracting it into the _Kenshi_ `mods` directory
3.  Enabling the mod in the game launcher
4.  Running the included multiplayer launcher or executable
5.  Configuring host settings and sharing the session IP with friends

Some versions include a dedicated server tool, while others rely on the host running both the game and the server instance simultaneously.

## Development

The Kenshi Unofficial Multiplayer Mod is maintained by independent modders and reverse‑engineering enthusiasts. Development focuses on:

-   Improving synchronization stability
-   Expanding support for AI‑heavy scenarios
-   Reducing crashes during large battles
-   Enhancing compatibility with popular overhaul mods

Because the mod relies on memory hooks and engine‑level workarounds, updates to _Kenshi_ may temporarily break compatibility until the mod is patched.

## Community Reception

The mod has been praised for making cooperative Kenshi gameplay possible for the first time, especially for exploration‑focused groups. Players enjoy the ability to:

-   Build bases together
-   Run squads in parallel
-   Explore dangerous regions as a team

However, the mod is also known for instability, occasional crashes, and desync issues. Most players view it as a “fun experiment” rather than a fully polished multiplayer mode.
