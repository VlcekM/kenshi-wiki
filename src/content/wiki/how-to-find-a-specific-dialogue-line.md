This marvelous step by step how to was posted in the Steam forums by Tablesalt. Images by Cattrina. This page is part of the [Dialogue Structure Overlook](/dialogue-structure-overlook#looking-for-a-specific-line-to-study-or-replace) guide.

  

EDIT: Shidan made a comment on this guide; since the original post was made, we have gotten an update from the devs. All you really need is to type 'text: Sure, follow' on the search when you are in the \_line tab without the ''. I leave this guide here anyways, maybe this can be used in some way.

_Want to know how certain dialogue back and forth is done in FCS? Want to change one single phrase to something else? But you just cannot find where the line is located in FCS?_

NOTE: to find word swaps you must search from the word swap category, and you do not find the word swap result from the notepad. You need to first know how the word swap is done and then look for the word swap fe. /MEUS/ from the note. BUT as word swaps are inherently used several times you might not find what you want. So, if you do not find the sentence with this method, it is either added by a non-vanilla mod or it is a word swap. Or there is a spelling mishap. Might just be a different ' that is used.

**Example:** you want to find the sentence 'Sure, follow me'. Vanilla game uses /MEUS/ in this sentence, so you need to look for 'Sure, follow /MEUS/'

**Example 2**: same way looking for 'sure follow' does not bring you a result, as the comma is missing.

### Here's how:

**1.** Open up Dialogue.mod in a text editor, like Notepad. Right click and select open with notepad.

It is located in the data folder in your Kenshi installation folder, fe. C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Kenshi\\data

If you are looking for a line in a not vanilla mod, you do this to the mod file. Those are in the workshop folder, and you might want to first copy it to your Kenshi/mods folder.

**2.** Search for the line you're looking for. Before the line itself, there'll be some information separated by pipe characters.

**3.** You're looking for the StringId (basically the identifier that Kenshi uses to identify the line). It'll look something like "48889-Dialogue.mod". Copy the number part.

**4**. Open up Forgotten Construction Set (it should be located in your install directory, next to the Kenshi executable). At this point you can create a new mod if you want to make changes or just hit "Done" if you just want to look at the dialogue.

**5**. In the "Game World" window, expand the "Dialogue Package" category at the left, then click the "\_lines" category.

**6**. Right click on the panel on the right and check the "Columns -> StringId" option. (This is not usually necessary).

**7**. Enter the StringId you copied from Dialogue.mod into the search bar at the bottom of the FCS panel.

**8.** There should be just one DIALOGUE\_LINE that matches it, so double click on that to open the dialogue view, where you can click around to get details about when the line is said, who says it, etc.
